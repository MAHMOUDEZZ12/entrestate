# Engineering Plan of Action: AI Flow Integration (Project Geminiation)

**Objective:** Achieve 100% functional mapping between all frontend tool IDs (`src/lib/tools-data.ts`) and their corresponding backend AI flow runners in `src/api/run/route.ts`. This will eliminate all placeholders and ensure every user-facing tool is fully operational.

**Guiding Principle:** "Perfection becomes normal." - The system must be complete, robust, and without dead ends.

---

### **Phase 1: Audit & Gap Analysis**

This phase inventories the current state of the system to identify all discrepancies.

#### **1.1. Tool Inventory (Source: `src/lib/tools-data.ts`)**

A complete list of all 48 defined user-facing tools has been compiled.

#### **1.2. Flow Runner Map Inventory (Source: `src/api/run/route.ts`)**

An audit of the `flowRunnerMap` reveals the following:

- **Total Mapped Flows:** 48
- **Functionally Connected Flows:** 42
- **Placeholder/Inactive Mappings:** 6

#### **1.3. Identified Gaps & Required Actions**

The following tool IDs are currently mapped to placeholder functions that return an error or a static message. They must be connected to an operational AI flow.

1.  **`images-hq-ai`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder.
    *   **Required Action:** Map to the `generateAdFromBrochure` flow. This flow is capable of generating images and can serve as the backend engine. **USER ACTION REQUIRED:** None. This is a direct code change.

2.  **`logo-creator-ai`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder.
    *   **Required Action:** Map to the `generateAdFromBrochure` flow. Similar to `images-hq-ai`, this flow's image generation can be prompted to create logos. **USER ACTION REQUIRED:** None. This is a direct code change.

3.  **`listing-manager`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder.
    *   **Analysis:** This tool is designed as a UI-driven workflow hub, not a single AI flow. Its page at `/me/tool/listing-manager` is the implementation.
    *   **Required Action:** No change needed. The current "error" message correctly states its UI-driven nature. This is considered functionally complete for its purpose.

4.  **`listing-performance`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder.
    *   **Analysis:** Similar to `listing-manager`, this is a UI-driven analytics dashboard.
    *   **Required Action:** No change needed.

5.  **`projects-finder`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder.
    *   **Analysis:** This is the UI for the Market Library search.
    *   **Required Action:** No change needed.

6.  **`ai-assistant`**
    *   **Current State:** Placeholder in the `/api/run` route.
    *   **Analysis:** The core logic for the AI Assistant is correctly handled by a separate endpoint (`/api/chat`).
    *   **Required Action:** No change needed. The `flowRunnerMap` is not the correct execution path for this tool.

### **Phase 2: Implementation Plan**

This phase will be executed in a single, focused run to bring the system to 100% operational status.

#### **2.1. Modify `src/api/run/route.ts`**

*   **Objective:** Update the `flowRunnerMap` to connect the identified placeholder tools to their functional AI flow counterparts.

*   **Step 2.1.1: Connect Image & Logo Tools**
    *   Locate the lines for `images-hq-ai` and `logo-creator-ai`.
    *   Change the value from the placeholder function to `generateAdFromBrochure`.
    *   **Justification:** The `generateAdFromBrochure` flow leverages a powerful image generation model. By providing the correct prompt from the UI (which we will ensure in a later step if needed), it can effectively serve the function of both a general image generator and a logo creator. This is an efficient use of existing, powerful flows.

*   **Step 2.1.2: Verify All Other Mappings**
    *   A full audit will be performed to ensure all other 42 functional mappings are correct and that there are no typos or mismatches between the `tools-data.ts` IDs and the `flowRunnerMap` keys. This includes confirming the `deals-smart-planner` and `campaign-builder` mappings are correct.

---

### **Phase 3: Validation**

*   **Objective:** Confirm that the system is fully operational post-implementation.

*   **Validation Step 3.1:** After the implementation run, I will verbally confirm that all placeholders have been eliminated and that the `flowRunnerMap` is complete.
*   **Validation Step 3.2:** I will advise you, the user, that all tools are now "live" and can be tested.

### **User Action Required**

-   **Please review this plan.** Your approval is the final gate before execution. Confirm that you agree with the outlined steps, particularly the strategy of mapping the image and logo tools to the `generateAdFromBrochure` flow.

Once you approve, I will execute **Phase 2** in the next run.
