# ESTCHAT X3 APP LITE 
## The Conversational Frontline

### The Vision & DNA
chatENT X3 APP LITE exists to solve the timeless problem of communication in real estate. Too often, buyers, investors, and brokers are separated by channels, misaligned by language, and slowed down by complexity. This product was designed to unify all conversations into a single intelligent stream — one that is proactive, context-aware, and commercially productive.
The DNA of chatENT is engagement-first intelligence. It doesn’t wait for the user to figure out what to ask; it guides, proposes, and translates. Whether on Instagram, a project landing page, or inside an enterprise learning dashboard, chatENT behaves as the frontline of interaction, never missing a lead, never losing a question, and always capturing intent.

### Product Core
At its core, chatENT X3 is a multi-channel AI assistant that:
* Engages users on Instagram, websites, campaigns, landing pages, and CRMs.
* Includes a prompt builder for brokers and marketers to customize campaign dialogues.
* Translates every conversation into structured data, knowledge, or contracts.
* Evolves through use, continuously improving the accuracy of responses and the relevance of its proposals.
chatENT is not a “bot.” It is an engagement infrastructure — one that can be scaled across agencies, developers, and regulators.

### Technology Stack & Architecture 
* **Frontend:** React-based embeddable widget + Instagram/Facebook API connectors.
* **Backend:** Google Cloud Functions + Firebase for real-time data sync.

* **Data Flow:**
    1. User interacts via channel (Instagram, site, etc.).
    2. Input routed to AI Orchestration Layer (Genkit).
    3. AI analyzes, classifies, and either answers, escalates, or logs to CRM.
    4. Every interaction enriches the lead profile database.
