# MEGA LISTING PRO 2 
## The Unified Market Registry

### The Vision & DNA
The real estate market is fragmented by noise — duplicate listings, misleading ads, outdated properties, and inconsistent pricing. MEGA LISTING PRO 2 was born to create one single source of truth.
Its DNA is market clarity. By consolidating, verifying, and archiving all listings, MEGA LISTING PRO 2 acts as the sovereign registry for real estate data. It does not merely collect; it filters, validates, and enforces accuracy, ensuring every participant — buyer, broker, investor, regulator — can operate from the same foundation of trust.

### Product Core
At its core, MEGA LISTING PRO 2 is a centralized, intelligent listing engine that:
* Aggregates listings from portals, developers, and brokers.
* Uses AI to detect duplicates, expired data, and false pricing.
* Outputs a clean, verified feed for websites, CRMs, and regulators.
* Archives every property record since 2005, preserving historical data for analytics.

### Technology Stack & Architecture
